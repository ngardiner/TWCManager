        # linkready1 message followed by 5 copies of linkready2 (I've never seen
        # more or less than 5 of linkready2).
        #
        # This linkready1 message advertises master's TWCID to other slaves on the
        # network.
        # If a slave happens to have the same id as master, it will pick a new
        # random TWCID. Other than that, slaves don't seem to respond to linkready1.

        # linkready1 and linkready2 are identical except FC E1 is replaced by FB E2
        # in bytes 2-3. Both messages will cause a slave to pick a new id if the
        # slave's id conflicts with master.
        # If a slave stops sending heartbeats for awhile, master may send a series
        # of linkready1 and linkready2 messages in seemingly random order, which
        # means they don't indicate any sort of startup state.

        # linkready1 is not sent again after boot/reset unless a slave sends its
        # linkready message.
        # At that point, linkready1 message may start sending every 1-5 seconds, or
        # it may not be sent at all.
        # Behaviors I've seen:
        #   Not sent at all as long as slave keeps responding to heartbeat messages
        #   right from the start.
        #   If slave stops responding, then re-appears, linkready1 gets sent
        #   frequently.

        # One other possible purpose of linkready1 and/or linkready2 is to trigger
        # an error condition if two TWCs on the network transmit those messages.
        # That means two TWCs have rotary switches setting them to master mode and
        # they will both flash their red LED 4 times with top green light on if that
        # happens.

        # Also note that linkready1 starts with FC E1 which is similar to the FC D1
        # message that masters send out every 4 hours when idle. Oddly, the FC D1
        # message contains all zeros instead of the master's id, so it seems
        # pointless.

        # I also don't understand the purpose of having both linkready1 and
        # linkready2 since only two or more linkready2 will provoke a response from
        # a slave regardless of whether linkready1 was sent previously. Firmware
        # trace shows that slaves do something somewhat complex when they receive
        # linkready1 but I haven't been curious enough to try to understand what
        # they're doing. Tests show neither linkready1 or 2 are necessary. Slaves
        # send slave linkready every 10 seconds whether or not they got master
        # linkready1/2 and if a master sees slave linkready, it will start sending
        # the slave master heartbeat once per second and the two are then connected.
